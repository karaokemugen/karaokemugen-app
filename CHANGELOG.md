# [8.0.37] - 2024-11-27

This release mostly contains bugfixes, notably the macOS mpv version that needed updating since latest macOS systems do not have Python installed anymore.

**KNOWN ISSUE** : on macOS, the newest mpv versions include an ffmpeg library that does not support what we use to display avatars on screen or QR Codes. As a result, these two features won't have any effect on macOS until we can figure out a solution or mpv ships with a better ffmpeg/ffmpeg does a release including the fix. (7.1 currently doesn't include the fix.)

Hey, at least you have mpv working now. :)

Collections can be browsed and used like any other tag type. However, they're enabled/disabled by the karaoke operator at the system leve, which means that if they disable the "World" or "Shitpost" collection, no one one (even them!) will see the songs there.

## Important notice regarding song management (#969)

Karaoke Mugen changes how it handles songs from version 5.1 and onwards.

We realize people don't wish to download all medias for all songs because it can take up a lot of space (currently ~420Gb) and don't seem to understand they need to donwload songs for them to appear in lists.

As a result, Karaoke Mugen will now download your repositories entirely if empty and keep them updated on startup.

Medias will be downloaded separately, as you need them :

- When you add a song to the current playlist, it'll be downloaded in the background.
- If you play a song from the library directly, and if it hasn't been downloaded, it'll be streamed directly from the repository's server.

There are ways for you now to see how much space a repository takes on your hard drive, and clean up unused songs manually or in bulk.

Since we're basing this work on git (we have Karaoke Mugen Server create a diff and then apply it to your files), your repository will be kept up to date when Karaoke Mugen starts. If medias have been updated for songs you have already downloaded the medias for before, they will be redownloaded.

## New features

- A blacklist criteria set "Safe for karaoke" is now created automatically the first time you start Karaoke Mugen. It contains all problematic tags like R18, Spoilers and Epilepsy. You can use it or not :) (#1013)
- You can now have music during pauses in your karaokes sessions. (#938)
    - Put any audio file in the `backgrounds` folder.
    - If the audio file has the same name as a particular background image, it'll be played when that background image appears.
    - If a background image has no audio file associated, it'll select a random music from the folder
- A new option "Use my favorites and song requests for stats" has been added to user profiles (#950)
- A new option "Location" has been added to user profiles to define where you are in the world. This is for the KoE (Karaoke On Earth) project (#951)
- Some improvements have been made for Twitch streamers :
    - The pause screen now has a progress bar (#967)
    - The pause screen can now be paused for a longer time if you need to, by hitting the Stop button in the player controls (#990)
    - The Twitch chat now has a `!song` command to display the current song being played (#996)
    - A new window containing the currently playing song and the next ones can be opened and captured via OBS to display on your stream layout (#998)
    - Karaoke Mugen now writes some useful information in text files so you can read them through OBS Studio or similar to get useful information. These are located in the `streamFiles` directory (#997) :
        - Current song name
        - URL to access your karaoke session
        - Interface status (opened/closed/restricted)
        - Number of songs in the current and public playlists

# v5.0.31 "Poppy Partagée" - 14/04/2021

## Important notice

_clears throat_ Karaoke Mugen 5.0 introduces a brand new singing experience for y'all! It contains a fully reworked public interface, which aims for ease of use and efficiency.

It also provides an easy way to share your karaoke with friends with **kara.moe subdomains** (example https://wxyz.kara.moe).

- Usernames are now **case-insensitive** (#770). Karaoke Mugen will detect name conflicts in your user database and eventually fixes them automatically or asking you to do something about. In any case, the accounts with conflictual names will be automatically renamed with suffixes.

## New features

### Privacy policy (#861)

Upon your first launch of this new version, you'll get a summary of the data we collect and how we use it. You can choose to disable data collection at anytime if you object to it.

We also added a system to more easily manage news updates whenever you install a new version of Karaoke Mugen (#845)

### Stats are now per repository (#875)

Stats can now be sent per-repository and are not global anymore. This means you can choose to send your stats data only to one repository but not to the other.

### Song versions (#855)

A new type of tag has been introduced in 5.0 : versions.

This will allow you to better filter out (or in) different song versions like "Alternative", "Off Vocal" or "Full".

### Remote access (#198)

Karaoke Mugen can now expose itself via Karaoke Mugen Server to allow other people on other networks to access your karaoke. Perfect for remote sessions at anime events or over Discord our Twitch.

![Remote Access control box](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/f769ef18debdb7e4d55abb9b3df91f77/Capture_d_écran_du_2020-12-31_00-08-25.png)

It can be enabled in Settings -> Karaoke. It will generate a token kept by Karaoke Mugen for you. It will allow your room URL (https://XXXX.kara.moe) to be always the same after restarting the app.

The tokens expire after 10 days of non-use, but you can ask an administrator of the server to promote your token into a permanent, customized one like Axel.kara.moe.

_In order to save bandwidth, some karaoke thumbnails or profile pictures may not be available for remote users, but this will not prevent them from adding these songs._

### New public interface (#804, #739, #551)

A brand new public interface is available with Karaoke Mugen 5.0. Our goal was to make the user experience better while providing more search tools and exploring capabilities.

- The current song lyrics are available on the home page
    - The current line is highlighted in yellow

![Lyrics Box](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/49f8517028bc3550e72631a7370fb154/Peek_31-12-2020_00-07.gif)

- The top progress bar has been replaced by a new bottom bar

![Bottom bar](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/43a3b9e5a235e9c3789b1efef43cc7d2/image.png)

- Homepage is now featuring a "now playing" box

![Player Box](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/8cc3b9e6d90d1bb9c6b2b16468c2962f/Capture_d_écran_2020-11-11_à_22.00.58.png)

- You can now explore tags by category

![Tags List](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/e9696536c20526808ada84b13520c085/Capture_d_écran_2020-11-11_à_21.57.50.png)

- Popular songs are now fetched from your configured repositories instead of checking on your local database. You can disable this (#872)

### New shuffle modes (#772)

We reworked our shuffle modes, including a new one: balancing. Balancing creates pools of users: each user will have one song per pool (A-B-C, A-B-C, etc.), it creates more fairness for people adding less songs than others.

![Shuffle button](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/karaokemugen/karaokemugen-app/uploads/5307ea7a7f92e4416cca7b11881324eb/image.png)

### Sort playlist by likes (#887)

You can now sort a playlist by its number of likes from your guests. The playlist can also auto-sort itself (it's another property in the edit playlist window)

### Accept/refuse songs (#902)

When having a public and current playlist side by side in the operator page, you can accept or refuse songs in the suggestion playlist.

- Accepted songs are copied into the current playlist and marked as free (thus freeing quota for the users who requested them)
- Refused songs just sit there. Refusing a song frees it for the user who requested it, but since the song is in the public playlist the song will not be requested ever again.
- Playlist can be viewed sorted by number of likes. Unaccepted/unrefused songs are shown first, then accepted then refused songs.

### Sessions exports (#773)

You can now more easily **export your sessions data** as .csv, it will contain songs requested by users, play history, etc.

### Chibi player (#725)

![Chibi player](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/code/karaokemugen-app/uploads/b6a4a7488db7456fadc30a37a15b18fb/Capture_d_%C3%A9cran_2020-12-04_%C3%A0_22.13.15.png)

**Chibi player** is a compact window designed to have easy controls over the Karaoke Mugen player, it can be set to be always on top of other windows.

It can be enabled in the Window menu.

## Breaking changes

- API is now **using a socket.io** interface, however `POST /api/command` with `{cmd: 'GetKaras', body: {body: {from: 0, size: 400}}}` can be used to send commands without establishing a socket.io command (#666).
    - This new API will be documented later, we lack workforce to do so right now.
- database.json config file is now merged with config.yml in `System.Database` object, see config sample (#746)
    - Karaoke Mugen should handle this change automatically for you and merge the two files

## Improvements

- Downloads are now made 3 at a time, not one at a time, to speed up big download queues (#910)
- Security code begone! The security code still exists when you're using a browser, but when using the app's electron browser, it will communicate with the app directly to get it and authenticate you. (#891)
- When creating automixes, the songs' requesters are now the ones who had that song in their favorites (#897)
- In streamer mode, stopping the player during a pause will disable pause time (allowing you to manually play the song once you're ready to sing again.) (#890)
- The player window now has borders! (you can disable them like it was before) (#889)
- Player window will stop resizing itself depending on the aspect ratio of the video (#888)
- In classic/streamer mode, the "Next song" text isn't underlined anymore. Apparently it was a crime against mankind to do so (#886)
- You can now bulk-add songs to your favorites, the white or black list from the operator panel. (#853)
- Blacklist criterias panel is now explained (#867)
- You can now see the download queue (#862)
- KM will now ask you if you want to resume pending download on startup if there are any, instead of resuming them automatically like it did before (#852)
- The tutorial has been revamped to be shorter and easier to understand (#839)
- The search engine can now understand exclusion (-word) and group ("group of words") operators.
- (Admin interface) Rename, set as current/public have been merged into a single "Edit playlist" button (#832)
    - The create playlist screen also allows you to set a playlist as public and/or current.
- Users now receive notifications when they can add songs again (when their quota becomes positive, #764).
- Upgrade from KM 3.2 works again (#798)
- When users upvote a song, it cannot be deleted by the original requester anymore (#803)
- Thumbnails are generated for each song now (for the public interface, #800)
- System panel navigation has been reworked with a new home page (#724)
- Tag names are now uniform against all our applications (#678)
- Player is now configured to have [loudnorm](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#loudnorm) normalization (bd2964bd) instead of replay gain calculation.
- Circled avatars aren't created by KM now but instead are automatically generated at playtime by lavfi filters (fb99c6ec)
- The stats/sentry consent is part of the setup procedure now (#830)
- Fingerprinting has been disabled. It allowed to recognize browsers/devices to keep them from unlogging and relogging as random guests to get new ones. Problem is a lot of browsers now keep the fingerprintjs library from working correctly for privacy/tracking reasons, so we stopped using it (#893)
- Database rework! We reworked how songs are stored and accessed in the database, making adding/editing/removing karaokes and tags will be much faster for karaoke database maintainers. It also allows you to edit your song library during a karaoke as it won't conflict with users accessing it (#884 #882)
- All window modals have been reworked and are more beautiful. (#881)
- Admin messages can now coexist with the other messages (Go to kara.moe, song informations, b2e2bc52)
- You can now delete a song with the flag_playing attribute set as long as it's not currently playing (#917)

## Fixes

- Time before a song is going to play is now correctly displaying the right time (#912)
- "Next song is..." notifications are disabled if the playlist is set as non visible (#896)
- Playing a song from the library when the current playlist is near the end does not trigger a outro/encore jingle anymore (#908)
- Telling if a user is connected to your karaoke session is now clearer (#906)
- Fixed playlist outro triggered even though another song is due to play. This happened when you moved around a song from the playlsit to the end, after the currently last song (#905)
- Karaoke and tag metadata can now contain | (pipe) characters (#844)
- Editing a kara repository was creating errors (#780)
    - Copying a karaoke to a new repo updates correctly the database (#778)
- In French, "Genres" are now "Thèmes" (#802)
- The "next" button was greyed out if you added a song when the last song was playing (#806)
- Karaokes with missing tags are now not included in generation (#797)
- In the karaoke creation form, hitting "Enter" in a tag input is no longer submitting the form (and thus creating a karaoke into database) (#789)
- Karaoke tags are always in the same order now (#786)
- Some typos were corrected in French locales (a8eab177)

- Better interception of "user already exists online" errors (986fde85)
- Avoid DB query error in case a played / requested song is added twice to the database at the exact same time (how it happened in the first place is beyond me, but your code is like your child, they can do surprising stuff sometimes, like you didn't think your cat would be stupid enough to fall in a chimney but yes, he did.) (215a11f3)
- Avoid sending stats payload if instance ID isn't set (Did I tell you about my cat and the neighbor's chimney?) (1a446b83)

Version numbering has changed :

- Major number version (here, 4) will change whenever we release a new version with additional features and change the character in the version's name
- Middle number version (here, first 0) will change whenever we release an official, stable version of Karaoke Mugen to the public. It'll contain bugfixes and small improvements over the previous version but won't introduce big changes. It changes the second part of the version name.
- Minor version number is subject to change more often. People on master and next branches will get a new minor version every sunday. These are usually automated.

You can find more info in issue #675

## New features

- Public/Private mode has been removed. From now on, playlists can have both current/public flags at once.
    - To get the old "public" behavior, have two playlists, one with the current flag and the other with the public flag.
    - To get the old "private" behavior, have one playlist with both current and public flags set.
- Operator UI has been overhauled and simplified (#704).
    - Less useless notifications
    - The "stop" button now defaults to stop after the current song ends. Press it again to stop the karaoke now.
    - Options have been moved to the K button
    - Current time and time remaining for a song are displayed in the progress bar
    - Jingles and sponsors now appear in the current playlist so the operator can tell when they're going to happen.
    - Playlist and Karaoke options are now in contextual menus inside the wrench icon
    - Filters can be reset
    - Previous & next song buttons are now greyed out if you're at the beginning or end of playlist. Play is greyed out as well if nothing is in the current playlist
    - Application settings have been moved out from the operator settings page. They're now in the system panel.
    - Some options have been simplified or removed.
- You can now play songs directly from the song library without having to add it to a playlist first (#697)
- After a playlist ends, Karaoke Mugen can play random songs until someone adds a new song to the playlist (kind of like an attract mode) (#698)
- Already present in 3.2.2 but this is an important change : A setup page has been added for those using Karaoke Mugen for the first time. It works as a setup wizard asking you questions about accounts and where to download your songs (#661)
- Playlists created from Karaoke Mugen Live or another Karaoke Mugen App can be given to the download page to download all songs in it that you don't have yet (#600)
- Sample songs are now only downloaded if the user wants them (#658)
- Series are now tags as well. This doesn't impact the end-user, but allowed us to clean more than 1500 lines of code since series and tags were treated separately but were basically the same kind of information related to a song. This should also speed up querying songs from the database (#629)
- When you view a different playlist than the current one and hit the play button, a warning will appear to tell you the playlist you're viewing isn't the one that's going to be played. (#634)
- Tips and tricks are displayed during the init phase to give you something to read (#674)
- We now use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to have errors reported to us automatically when they happen. Since this has privacy issues, this can be disabled. Just like for Stats Uploads, you will be asked if you want to allow that or not when updating. (#676 #709)
- Generation during init phase now has a progressbar (#693)
- Karaoke groups are now better displayed on the download page so you can more easily find them and add them to your download queue directly (#646)
- Playlists now has icons depending on their type in the selection list (#612)
- Karaoke Mugen can now handle different kind of files if you drag & drop them into its window or if you associate Karaoke Mugen to th em in your OS so you only need to double-click on them (#689 #600):
    - `.kara.json` files will be played directly (if they exist in your database)
    - `.karabundle` files will add a karaoke to your database. It's an efficient way to download individual songs from the web.
    - `.kmplaylist` files will add a playlist to your database. **If some songs are not in your database, they will be downloaded.**
    - `.kmfavorites` files will replace your favorites with the ones in the file
    - `.kmblcset` will add a new set of blacklist criterias to your list (more info below)
- Added blacklist criterias sets : you can now create different sets of blacklist criterias and switch from one to the other depending on where you're doing your karaoke. Example, between friends, at a wedding, at an anime convention, etc.
- Discord Rich Presence has been added. You can now proudly display what you're singing on in your Discord profile status! This can be disabled. (#685)
- Security code can now be copied to your clipboard in its dialog box (#670)
- Song info popup can now be closed by clicking elsewhere on the screen (#641)
- Added a tool in system panel to compare two repositories and check if lyrics are different between the two if there are identical songs, and allow to update them. This will help song base maintainers to keep multiple repositories with the same songs in sync (#681)
- Added a tool in system panel to show tags with the same name but different types, which could be merged into the same tag. This will help song base maintainers when a singer is also a songwriter but has different identifiers in the database, for example (#672)
- Added a tool in system panel to add/remove a specific tag from a list of songs (#655)
- A database dump is automatically created on startup, allowing you to restore it in case of problems. This will also allow us to upgrade the database software (postgresql) later more easily. (#648)
- A queue has been added to heavy database actions like generations and refreshes, thus avoiding weird behaviors when multiple tasks are triggered at the same time (#639 #638)
- Added a validate button to the database page in system panel to only validate changed files without triggering a generation (#635)
- A details button is available to display song details in the download window (#632)
- Switched database migration tool from db-migrate to postgrator, allowing us to trigger specific tasks when a user updates Karaoke Mugen to the latest version. For example the fact that series are now tags will tell you the app needs to update your songs and ask you if you want that to happen or not (#627)
- All system panel messages are now translated in French (and English of course) (#621)
- Hardware acceleration is now enabled by dafault in auto-safe mode to allow hardware decoding of videos in the most standard cases. You can disable it in case it doesn't work right for you or force it enabled for all videos (not recommended) (#703)
- A new option setting allows you to add extra arguments to mpv's command line, for advanced users only (#703)
- The public interface now lets you easily vote for a song already present in the public playlist when you browse the main song list (#714 #713)
- You can now use media keys on your keyboard if it has them (stop, previous, next, and play/pause) to control Karaoke Mugen (not on macOS due to a bug in Electron 9.x) (#718)

## Improvements

- Passwords are now stored in a more secure way (salted bcrypt instead of SHA256) (#701).
    - As an improvement to account security, changing your password from KM Server or another KM App instance will automatically log you out of other instances, as KM Server now stores the last time your password has been modified.
- User role is now checked when making requests to the API, so that users who lost their admin status can't keep it forever (#588)
- Migrated system panel from antd framework v3 to v4, resulting in better visuals and cleaner code (#610 #593)
- Total repositories size is now displayed in the download page (#626)

- System panel's dark mode is now complete (#663)
- Singers and series auto-complete is now a bit faster in system panel's karaoke creation tool (#662)
- SQL code is better organized in the app's source code (#688)
- When changing a repository's priority (moving it in the list) a timer will only validate your changes and regenerate your database after a bit (#687)
- The MPV component has been rewritten using our own IPC implementation, because of many issues with node-mpv. We've seen with the node-mpv author to fix some issues with some patches. (#684 #711 #719)
- Init phase has been a bit reworked when you display logs (#683)
- Unit tests are now started at the end of the app's launch, speeding up continuous integration cycle (#633)

# v3.2.0 "Nadia Naturiste" - 04/04/2020

This is a major release with almost only UX features and improvements, so you should be safe to upgrade.

## New features

- The app now uses Electron for a better user experience on all
  platforms (#533)
    - All links are opened in Electron by default, but you can disable this behavior in the application's menu (#581)
    - A new command flag `--cli` has been added to launch the app without any GUI (for non-interactive operations like updates or generation, or for use on Raspberry Pi (#575)
    - Player progress bar is now visible in the Dock (macOS) or taskbar (Windows) (#572)
    - A initialization page with optional logs is shown at startup (#568)
    - Karaoke Mugen is now packaged in these formats :
        - macOS: .dmg for easy install
        - Windows: portable (.zip) and .exe installer
        - Linux: appImage
    - There is an auto-update system in place which will download updates and install them on startup (unless told not to) or when manually told to. (#7)
    - The Visual C++ Redistribuable 2013 is now included during install on Windows, and installed if it appears you lack some vital DLL files for PostgreSQL (#595)
    - Errors will open a system dialog box
    - When prompted to select a folder or file (in config page, in repositories pages) a Open File system dialog will be used if you're visiting these pages using the electron app instead of a browser. If you're in a browser, a HTML5 browser will be used
- Multiple repository management for songs (#549)
    - Songs are now organized in repositories.
    - You can have multiple repositories in your Karaoke Mugen
    - By default you have a "kara.moe" repository and a "Local" one. The Local one is for your own songs that you don't necessarily want to share with the community through kara.moe.
    - You can add, remove, or edit repositories, if for example someone adds a new song database completely foreign to kara.moe.
    - Repositories can be enabled or disabled depending on the situation. A disabled repository won't be taken into account when generating database or updating stuff.
    - A "Consolidate repository" button allows to move repositories' contents to a new folder (like on a external hard drive) (#569)
- Users are notified when their song is going to play as soon as they add it (#564)
- When streaming Karaoke Mugen to twitch, song polls will be sent to the twitch chat as well so users can vote for it as soon as it is happening, to avoid polls ending sooner without users being able to vote for it due to stream lag (#602)
- Tags and series are now checked when running a song database update. Previously they were not checked, which meant that unless you download a song which used them, you wouldn't get the new data (#616)
- A new "tasks" system allows you to quickly see which background tasks are running on Karaoke Mugen : media updates, downloads, database generation, etc. Tasks are visible on the system panel and the welcome screen

## Improvements

- Initialization is now faster since we're checking file modification dates instead of contents to decide if we need to generate or not (#563)
- Generation is faster as duplicate SID/TID/KIDs check is now done with maps instead of arrays
- Audio visualizer on audio-only songs is now smaller and in a corner of the screen to give more room to artwork (#559)
- Various improvements have been made to the system panel, especially its navigation and to download manager (#579)
- mpv (player) logs have been moved to the logs/ directory (#574)
- Logs are in JSON format now which allows a standardized display in the control panel logs. Logs are now updated in real time on that page (#567)
- Login is now shared between the system panel and frontend (#594)
- You can modify songs without medias (#604)
- Rework of operator tutorial and public tutorial (1130eb69, be5413a8)

## Fixes

- Fix playlist not working if a user added a song to it before, and does not exist anymore or has been converted from local to online. Thanks @Yom for finding this.
- Fix download of songs with # or % in their names.
- Fix download page not showing songs if you change filter while being on a page other than the first one. Now page view is reset when you change filters. Thanks @Cattenize for spotting this and writing an issue! (#620)
- Fix issues with playlist medias updates through git (encores, intros, outros, etc.) by using a HTTP download system instead of using git, which tended to block the main thread and make the app unresponsive for a bit while it decompressed files (#582)

- Fix get blacklist criterias from public (6a0fcbe3)

    - Instead of downloading tag, series, karas and ass files separately, they're downloaded in one bundle and separated again aftar download (#562)
- The enter key can now be used to login (58ec5d14)
- Song suggestions (when you can't find what you're looking for) now ask for more information because we were tired of getting useless demands for songs we did have no clue what they were (#560)
- Deciding to run KM on another port than the default 1337 one is only decided on first run of the app. If the port is busy and it's not the first time you run KM, it'll throw an error (9eaccd60)

# v3.0.0 "Leafa Lumineuse" - 29/11/2019

Many things have changed, both in database schemas, code base, frontend, and even how Karaoke Mugen works

## New Features

- A banner will be displayed on the welcome screen to signal there is a new Karaoke Mugen version and that you should upgrade (#7)
- All guest accounts now have specific avatars. For fun. (#392)
- Karaoke data files (.kara) are now on version 4 and are named .kara.json. (#341)
    - Karaoke Mugen 3.x is not compatible with Karaoke files version 3 or below. This means you'll need to update your Karaoke Base for Karaoke Mugen 3.x.
    - If you have songs you have not uploaded to the Karaoke Base, please contact us so we can help you convert your files.
- Streamer mode with Twitch integration (#447)
    - Song poll results can be displayed on the player's wallpaper inbetween songs.
    - Twitch users can vote from chat for which song to play next
    - Added a configurable pause time in between songs.
- Song tags have been completely reworked (#443)
    - Tags (languages, songwriters, singers, creators, etc.) are now files in the Karaoke Base, which means they're not tied to the application's version anymore. Anyone can add its own tags if need be.
    - New tag types : Misc (formerly "Tags"), Genres, Origins, Platforms and Families
    - New tags have been added to the Karaoke Base as a result : Fanworks for dojin songs/videos
    - WARNING : As a result, blacklists criterias relying on tags won't be valid anymore and are going to be removed from your blacklist criterias. You can readd them later.
- Mystery karaoke toggle (#441)
    - You can flag a song as visible or invisible. Invisible songs will be marked as ??? to the public, which means they won't know in advance what that song is in the playlist. Good for surprises and troll songs.
    - You can add mystery labels, which are shown randomly in place of the real song's name in a song slot to users. This is troll ammo.
    - You can make it so admins or users added songs are automatically marked as invisible (or not)
- Classic Karaoke Mode (#432)
    - In Karaoke Classic mode, a pause is made in between songs, and the person who requested the song (or admin, or after a time period has elapsed) can hit play on its device. This is a mode for those who prefer a classic karaoke box experience where each user takes the microphone to sing on the song they asked for.
- New features for Download manager :
    - Blacklist system to keep the Download manager to automatically download some songs. Manual download is still possible (#427)
    - A "Update All" button to update existing songs and download all songs missing from your database. See above for the blacklist feature. (#426)
    - Advanced search (via tags/series) (#425)
- Session management on welcome screen (#390)
    - You can now name individual karaoke sessions when starting one with friends or during events. It'll allow you to filter song history to see, for example, which songs were played during Epitanime 2020 or Jonetsu 5555. Sessions are just groups for stats but can be helpful for other purposes later.
    - Session data can be exported as CSV (#508)
- QR Code has been removed (why is it a new feature?) (#451)
- Users can now select which language for series names they tend to prefer (just like an admin can). This setting is saved to your online account. (#440)
- New, updated sample songs included with every release (#452)
- Battle-tested with Node 12 (#439)
- Karaoke Mugen is now coded with TypeScript, for better debugging and safer programming :) (#437 #391)
- For MugenPi users (or those who don't want to look at the console screen), logs are now available in the System Control Panel (#434)
- Live changes to the database (editing a song) won't trigger a new generation on next app startup (#433)
- Admins can restrict song additions by users to one song per series or singer to avoid people trying to force their favorite series or singer by adding all its songs (#431)
- A new (shy) look for the frontend has been achieved with the React rewrite (#430 #300)
- Suggesting a song to be added to the karaoke base now generates an issue on our Gitlab (configurable) (#422)
- An intro video is played at the beginning of a playlist if you're starting on the first song. If a sponsor jingle file is present (Beginning with `Sponsor - `) it will be played right after. (#482)
- The karaoke submission form now accepts new karaoke formats in addition of ASS. The files will be converted to the ASS format on import. New formats supported are :
    - Toyunda files (.txt) (#463)
    - UltraStar files (.txt) (#31)
    - Karafun files (.kfn) (#471)
- Dark theme for the system panel (#468)
- Settings in the options panel now have tooltips to explain what they do (#460)
- Login modal in public and admin interface now has toggles for online/local accounts and password reset feature. (#489)
- Database can be restored from the karaokemugen.sql file in the application's directory (#509)

## Improvements

- System panel's code dependencies are now up to date (#445)
- Playlist information is updated more often on screen so a device coming back from sleep mode can get an updated version of the page sooner (#416)
- Search engine in playlists now looks for the song requester as well. (#448)
- Quotations (" and ') are now taken into account during search (#446)
- Karaoke Mugen's API has been split in smaller chunks for easier debugging and programming.
- A lot of code is now shared between Karaoke Mugen App and Server via the Karaoke Mugen Shared Library (#402) saving us a lot of time
- Importing playlists is now safer thanks to a code rewrite by using constraints instead of tests (#329)
- Preview videos are not generated anymore. It was costly and took a hell lot of time. Now full media files are served instead (#457)
- Updated mpv version to 0.29.1.
- Karaoke base updates now go through the Download Manager and should easier to handle.
- When editing a karaoke in the system UI, tags and series are checked for differences between the old and new karaoke to avoid triggering useless refreshes.
- Added a message in case MS Visual Studio C++ 2013 redist is not installed (Windows only) (#492)
- Karaoke Mugen behaves better when mpv has been shutdown outside of KM (#491)
- Added `--dumpDB` and `--restoreDB` command-line arguments.

## Fixes

- Toggling lyrics/song title display on mobile now works properly (#414)
- Videos aren't weboptimized again even if you don't change anything about it in the edit song form (#436)
- Toots from Mastodon are now displayed proper on the welcome screen's feed (#429)
- Fix KM not allowing you to login your online account if a local account with the same nickname exists in your database. (#466)
- When working with several karaoke/media/lyrics folders, edited karas will be placed in the original folders they belong to instead of the
  first one in the list.
- i18n fields in series edit page in control panel are now automatically validated, no need to fiddle with them anymore (#505)
- .ass files are now properly deleted when editing a kara (#490)

This is a major release.

## New features

- Songs can now be downloaded individually from a Karaoke Mugen Server (like `kara.moe`) instead of updating the complete karaoke base every time. Go to the Karas -> Downloads submenu in the system panel. This feature is still in beta and we would love feedback (#339)
- Users can now create online accounts on a Karaoke Mugen Server, which means favorites and profile info are stored online and not on the local Karaoke Mugen application. Online accounts are enabled by default. To create/login using local accounts, remove the `kara.moe` part of the Server field on the login/new account form (#303)
- Added tag CREDITLESS for creditless songs (#382)
- Added tag COVER for cover songs (#393)
- Added tag DRAMA for songs from TV drama shows (#393)
- Added tag WIIU for songs from Nintendo Wii U games
- Added tag FANDUB for fandubbed videos (#418)
- Already present since 2.4.1 : Stats are now uploaded periodically to Karaoke Mugen Server (if the instance admin agrees) (#377)

## Improvements

- Configuration storage has been completely revamped and is now a YAML file instead of the old INI format. Your old configuration file will be automatically imported at launch (#355)

- New option `--reset` to reset user data. WARNING : this wipes users, stats, playlists, etc.
- Configuration is not updated anymore in real time if you modify the config file while Karaoke Mugen is running (it caused too many problems). You'll need to modify the config file while Karaoke Mugen is stopped for your changes to take effect.
- All communication with Karaoke Mugen Server is now done in HTTPS.
- Executable file has been greatly reduced by replacing some packages with simpler, lighter versions with similar functionality
- Preview generation should be more consistent now

# v2.2.3 "Haruhi Hyperactive" - 16/07/2018

## Fixes

## Enhancements

- Default video directory is now `medias`
- Samples have been updated with a `medias` folder.
- Samples now include a `series.json` sample file
- macOS releases are now in `.tar.gz` instead of `zip` to keep permissions intact.

# v2.2.1 "Haruhi Hypnotisante" - 19/06/2018

This version is also known as "Just Haruhi"

## IMPORTANT

In preparation for **July 1st 2018** when the videos folder will be renamed to "medias", your videos folder will be renamed automatically after this date if :

- Your config has the default `app/data/videos`
- That folder exists
- The `medias` folder does not exist.

If any of these conditions are not met, proceed as usual, your configuration and folder structure won't be modified.

## Enhancements

- `userdata.sqlite3` is backupped before running integrity checks so you can recover from a bad karaoke database generation that would have wiped out your playlists, favorites, and other data.
- Added TAG_WII
- Added TAG_SATURN
- Config file change message is now debug only.

## Fixes

- The .kara generation tool has been fixed. Also, if a .kara's subfile has `dummy.ass` it won't trigger a subtitle extraction on its .mkv file anymore. Some .mkvs have hardsubs, yes.
- Blacklisting series now work correctly.
- When triggering the player's play method, make sure it is ready before.
- #316 Base updater should handle connection timeouts better.
- Fixed database generation when using `--generate` without any database existing.

# v2.2.0 "Haruhi Hagiographique" - 04/06/2018

For a complete changelog of v2.2 changes, check out v2.2-rc1's changelog below.

Changes from v2.2-rc1 to v2.2 :

## Bonus features

- #314 Karaoke Mugen can optionally publish its public and local IP to `kara.moe` to allow people to type a shorter URL in order to access the instance from the local network. `kara.moe` will redirect to your local instance.
- #312 A monitor window can be spawned for the player, allowing you, karaoke session operator, to see what the others see on the big screen where your main window is.
- Added new guest names and quotes
- Karaoke Mugen will check during startup if all guests exist. If not, new guests will be added to the user list. So you won't miss on new updates!
- Added the "Duo" tag for karaokes meant to be sung by two people.
- Added a demo mode for online demonstrations (passwords can't be changed and mpv is not controllable)
- .ass files are now read directly by mpv and not by Karaoke Mugen then passed to mpv anymore.

## Fixes

- #313 Control panel's user list now displays dates correctly
- Better error handling for mpv thanks to node-mpv new features
- Database generation from the control panel now works again
- Removed useless code in initial database creation. The `appFirstRun` setting will be overriden to 1 if `userdata.sqlite3` is missing.
- Searches containing quotes (') now return results
- Blank series data is created if it exists in a .kara file but not in the `series.json` file. This allows you to search for that series even if it's not in the JSON file. NOTE : this throws an error in strict mode.

# v2.2-rc1 "Haruhi Hargneuse" - 24/05/2018

This version requires your attention on the following points :

- `PathMedias` setting for storing media files replaces `PathVideos`
- Videos will be stored in a `medias` folder, not `videos` anymore starting July 1st 2018
- .kara format is going to be version 3 from now on, which means older versions of Karaoke Mugen won't be able to import the [Karaoke Base](https://gitlab.com/karaokemugen/bases/karaokebase) beyond July 1st 2018

## New Shiny Features

- #302 As a regular user, you can now remove your own submissions from the current/public playlist, in case you added a song by mistake for instance.
- #288 Alternative series names have been overhauled. We now have a database of series' names depending on language. Admins can select which way series should be displayed:
    - As they are originally (use japanese titles for japanese shows, etc.)
    - According to the song's language (use japanese titles for japanese songs, english titles for english songs, etc.)
    - According to Karaoke Mugen's language (uses system locale to determine which language to use. Defaults back to english and then original name)
    - According to the user's language (uses your browser's language to determine which language to use. Defaults back to english adn then original name)
- #282 Support for audio-only karaokes
    - You can create karaokes with mp3+ass files, for songs which do not have any video available anywhere on the Internets.
    - Supported formats are mp3, m4a and ogg.
    - Your file should have a cover art metadata. If it does it'll be used as background. If not KM's default background will be used.
    - Enjoy your long versions of songs :)
    - As a result KM's .kara format evolves to version 3. Version 2 can still be imported safely in KM 2.1 and below. Version 3 can only be imported in 2.2 and higher.
    - `videos` folder now becomes the `medias` folder. To help with this.
- #279 Song history can now be viewed in the control panel (administration).
    - This is a list of most viewed songs.
- #273 You can import/export your favorites.
    - Useful when you go from one karaoke session to the other, carry your favorites on your phone anywhere and import them in the KM instance you're using!
- #233 Song rankings can now be viewed in the control panel. This is a list of most requested songs (not necessarily viewed)
- #109 Adding songs can now be limited to either number of songs or time.
    - For example you can give users 5 minutes of karaoke each.
    - Adding songs longer than their time left is not allowed.
    - Just like with songs, time is given back once the song is freed or is being played on screen.
- #79 Public vote mode can be enabled and offers a poll to users on their devices with 4 songs to choose from.
    - Songs are taken from the public/suggestions playlist.
    - Poll lasts 30 seconds and the winner song is added to the current playlist.
    - If two or more songs are the highest in votes, a random one is chosen among them.
    - Another poll is created.
    - This is perfect if you want to have your users participate in the current playlist creation or if you want to just lean back and enjoy karaoke with friends without worrying about the playlist (create an AutoMix and make it a public playlist, then enable this mode)

## Enhancements

- #304 Search fields now includes who added the song in a playlist
- #297 Small tweaks made to the welcome page
- #291 Jingle information is now displayed in the UI's song bar when a jingle is playing
- #290 ASS files are no longer stored in the database.
    - This should make database generation much faster
    - Modifying an ASS file (to test stuff while making karaokes) will have an immediate effect now.
- #288 Search/filtering is now done in SQL, which greatly improves speeds
- #285 Config file is now validated and ignored if there are mistakes anywhere

## Fixes

- #299 Better handling of how Karaoke Mugen is shut down regarding database access (should remove any SQLITE_BUSY errors)
- #295 Forbidden messages won't be displayed anymore on first login
- #311 Autoplay/Repeat playlist now behave correctly

# v2.1.2 "Gabriel Gênante" - 16/05/2018

## Information

- Minimum required NodeJS version is now 8.4.0. This does not affect you if you use the packaged, binary versions of Karaoke Mugen

## Fixes

- Fixed favorites list not being displayed properly
- A proper error message is displayed when trying to add a song already present in the playlist
- #298 Jingles list is now properly created. You won't run out of jingles anymore!

## Enhancements

- #294 Karaoke Mugen now exits after karaoke base update is done.
- #296 "Press key on exit" is only displayed if there's an error.

## Features removed

- #7 We pulled a Sony on you and removed the software updater. It wasn't working to begin with and needed separate development efforts. If someone's up for it...

## Fixes

    - Déposez de courtes vidéos dans le dossier `app/jingles` (ou tout autre dossier de votre choix via le paramètre `PathJingles` de votre fichier `config.ini`)
    - Réglez le paramètre "Intervalle entre les jingles" dans l'interface ou modifiez `EngineJinglesInterval` pour définir le nombre de chansons qui doivent passer avant qu'un jingle ne passe (20 chansons par défaut, soit environ 30 minutes de karaoké)
    - Les jingles ne sont pas affichés dans la playlist !
    - Leur gain audio est calculé au démarrage de l'app (#185)
- #180 Le QR Code est maintenant affiché en surimpression par le lecteur vidéo
    - Démarrage du coup plus rapide car pas de fichier image à modifier.
    - Déposez des fonds d'écran dans le dossier `app/backgrounds` et Karaoke Mugen en prendra aléatoirement un pour l'afficher entre deux chansons.
- #182 Dans l'affichage des playlists, le temps restant de celle-ci s'affiche désormais en bas à droite.
- #172 Les fichiers de log sont maintenant nommés avec la date du jour.
- #175 Les chemins spécifiés dans le fichier `config.ini` peuvent maintenant être multiples.
    - Karaoke Mugen ira chercher dans chaque dossier (karas, paroles, vidéos, fonds d'écran
      , jingles...) tous les fichiers s'y trouvant. Par exemple si vous avez trois dossiers de vidéos listés, Karaoke Mugen vérifiera la présence de vidéo dans chaque dossier avant d'abandonner.
    - Pour indiquer plusieurs dossiers, il faut séparer leurs chemins par des pipes `|`. `Alt Droit + 6` sur un clavier AZERTY. Exemple : `app/data/videos|D:/mesvideostest`
    - Les chemins seront traités dans l'ordre. Si une même vidéo (par exemple) existe dans deux dossiers, c'est celle du premier dossier listé qui sera prise en priorité
- #174 Ajout d'un paramètre `EngineAutoPlay` (Lecture Automatique) qui lance la lecture automatiquement dés qu'un karaoké est ajouté, si celui est sur stop.
    - Pour toujours plus de KARAOKE INFINI.
- #174 Ajout d'un paramètre `EngineRepeatPlaylist` (Répéter la playlist courante)
    - Cela permet de relancer celle-ci automatiquement lorsqu'on arrive au dernier morceau.
- #137 Nouvelle fonction Lire Ensuite.
    - Un clic droit sur le bouton d'ajout d'un kara permet de l'insérer pile après la chanson en cours !
- #179 Boutons de navigation "retour en haut/en bas/kara en cours" ajoutés
- #196 Personnalisation des infos affichées en bas de l'écran durant les pauses/jingles
    - `EngineDisplayConnectionInfo` : Affiche ou non les infos de connexion (défaut : 1)
    - `EngineDisplayConnectionInfoQRCode` : Affiche ou non le QR Code (défaut : 1)
    - `EngineDisplayConnectionInfoHost` : Force une adresse IP/nom d'hôte pour l'URL de connexion (défaut : vide)
    - `EngineDisplayConnectionInfoMessage` : Ajoute un message avant celui avec l'URL. Par exemple pour indiquer un réseau Wifi auquel se connecter au préalable.
    - Les informations de connexion sont réaffichées à 50% de la chanson en cours pendant 8 secondes
- #195 Les informations de la chanson sont maintenant affichées aussi à la fin de la chanson en cours
- Il est désormais possible d'indiquer à Karaoke Mugen un chemin web (HTTP) pour récupérer les vidéos s'il ne les trouve pas dans vos dossiers.
    - Si vous êtes sur un réseau local ou que vos vidéos sont hébergées sur Internet, vous pouvez spécifier `PathVideosHTTP=http://monsiteweb.com/videos` pour que Karaoke Mugen streame les vidéos. Cela ne les télécharge pas définitivement sur votre disque dur !
- #189 Des openings ou endings spécifiques peuvent être recherchés désormais.
- La recherche prend en compte l'auteur du karaoké
- #184 Le temps de passage d'un karaoké dans la liste de lecture courante est indiqué (genre "dans 25 minutes")
- Les karas dans la liste publique/de suggestions sont supprimés dés qu'ils sont joués en courante.
- #135 L'interface est traduite en anglais et français et se base sur la langue de votre navigateur. On a posé les bases pour une traduction en d'autres langues
- #197 Bouton aller au début/en fin de playlist et aller au kara en cours de lecture
- #204 Nouveau critère de blacklist (nom de la série)
- #92 Une limite de chansons par utilisateur a été mise en place.
    - Une fois définie, la limite empêche les gens d'ajouter un karaoké s'ils ont déjà ajouté trop de chansons. Une fois les chansons de l'utilisateur passées, il peut en ajouter de nouvelles.

- #190 La suppresion de plusieurs karaokés devrait être plus rapide

## Développement

- Passage à Babel/ES2015+ tout doucement. (Nécessite Node8)
- **Modification d'API** : Les messages de réponse de l'API ont été complètement revus, consultez la documentation pour plus d'informations.
- #135 Les retours de l'API ont été normalisés. Une doc plus précise et complète va bientôt être disponible

## Mettre à jour

### Versions binaires

- Soon(tm)

### Version source

- Récupérer le dernier code source

```sh
git fetch
git checkout v2.0-rc1
```

- Mettre à jour les packages

```sh
yarn install
```

Si `yarn` n'est pas installé :

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

`npm`, c'est un peu comme Internet Explorer, son seul intêret c'est d'installer `yarn`

# v2.0 Beta 2 "Finé Foutraque" - 29/09/2017

## Améliorations

- #130 Le bouton "J'ai de la chance !" piochera désormais dans le résultat de votre recherche. Par exemple si vous tapez "Naruto" il prendra au hasard un OP/ED de Naruto.
- #134 Ajouter une selection deselectionne les karas selectionnés (une modification selectionnée par nos soins)
- #138 Lors d'un changement de paramètre nécessitant un redémarrage du lecteur, celui-ci redémarrera à la fin de la chanson en cours (par exemple changer d'écran ne peut pas être fait à la volée)
- #144 L'export de liste de lecture (et l'import) prend désormais en compte où vous en étiez dans la liste de lecture
- #146 L'administrateur peut maintenant afficher des messages à l'écran du karaoké ou sur les interfaces des utilisateurs (ou les deux). L'affichage à l'écran supporte les tags ASS.
- #164 L'application refusera de démarrer si vous n'avez pas mpv 0.25 d'installé sur votre système. Cela ne concerne que les cas où vous fournissez votre propre mpv à Karaoke Mugen.
- #143 Les paramètres pour spécifier les binaires de mpv selon votre OS (`BinPlayerOSX`, `BinPlayerWindows` et `BinPlayerLinux`) sont désormais bien pris en compte
- #145 Lors du premier lancement, ce sont cinq karaokés aléatoires qui sont ajoutés à la liste de lecture courante, pas juste les 5 premiers.
- #73 Le fond d'écran quand un karaoké n'est pas actif est maintenant personnalisable ! Spécifiez son nom avec l'option `PlayerBackground` dans votre fichier `config.ini`. Les fonds d'écran doivent être déposés dans le dossier `app/backgrounds`
- #62 La génération ne foutra plus en l'air vos .kara en cas d'erreur inattendue.
- #154 Lors de la génération, les fichiers cachés sont ignorés.
- #131 Utiliser la molette quand la souris passe sur la fenêtre du lecteur monte ou descend le son au lieu d'avancer/reculer dans la vidéo.
- #165 Sous macOS, le fichier de log reste dans le dossier de Karaoke Mugen (avant il allait dans le dossier home de l'utilisateur)
- #60 La génération de la base de données affiche désormais sa progression pour éviter de vous faire baliser lorsque que votre ordinateur est trop lent.
- Le lecteur vidéo sous macOS gére bien mieux le plein écran (utilisation de `--no-native-fs`)
- Les informations à l'écran lorsqu'un karaoké n'est pas en cours sont écrites plus clairement, et le QR Code mieux dimensionné
- Les listes de lecture sont maintenant triées par nom
- L'interface est désormais totalement en thème sombre

## Correctifs

- #133 Le paramètre "Toujours au dessus" fonctionne désormais normalement
- #136 Fixes d'interface et francisation de nombreux éléments texte encore en anglais
- #140 Revue du CSS de l'interface
- #129 Optimisation de la base de données pour ne plus ajouter d'ASS vides en cas de hardsubs.
- #148 L'initialisation de certaines pages de la webapp se passe mieux
- Lors de la génération de la base de données, le champ "series" d'un .kara est maintenant pris en compte correctement
- De nombreux, nombreux correctifs d'interface.
- L'import de grandes playlists fonctionne désormais normalement
- Le lecteur s'arrête normalement si la liste de lecture courante est vide et qu'on essaye de la jouer.
- Lorsque la base de données est vide, le Dummy Plug s'active pour vous ajouter 5 karaokés au hasard de votre base. Il n'y aura plus de message d'erreur si vous avez moins de 5 karaokés, voire pas de karaoké du tout.

## Problèmes connus

- Sous certaines configurations macOS, un warning de type `UnhandledPromiseRejection` peut apparaître au changement de chansons, nous sommes sur le coup. Ce message n'empêche en aucun cas d'utiliser l'application.
- Si vous avez des critères de blacklist assez divers, certains peuvent être éronnés après une regénération de votre base. Pensez à les vérifier après chaque génération ! Voir l'issue #114
